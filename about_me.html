<div class="paragraph"><p>Who is B? That is the question. Well I'm here to tell you that B is all things D (Detroit). I am a true Detroiter through and through, who enjoys living in the heartbeat of the city. For fun I spin tunes & create them whenever the opportunity presents itself. For a living I sell mortgages and God willing soon I'll be able to say I'm a developer for a fortune 500 company. When I'm not working I can assure you that I'm out enjoying the city in every way possible. I love bike riding through the city while discovering new hangouts and in the summer rooftop parties are my favorite.
