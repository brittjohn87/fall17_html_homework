<div class="paragraph"><p>September of 2015, I had the pleasure of witnessing first hand Murals in the Market. As a self-proclaimed "artist" I really enjoyed this event. I had the pleasure of witnessing some of my favorite artists create masterpieces in not only my city but my neighborhood as well. Everyone was so inspiring and delightful to speak to and they weren't bothered by us spectators as we watched the process. I was so thrilled and intrigued with the concept and artwork that I chose to take some photographs for my dj business with the murals as my backdrop.
